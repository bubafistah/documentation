# FreeBSD:

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Linux above. If you are running Lethean in a jail you need to add the flag: `allow.sysvipc=1` to your jail configuration, otherwise lmdb will throw the error message: `Failed to open lmdb environment: Function not implemented`.

We expect to add Lethean into the ports tree in the near future, which will aid in managing installations using ports or packages.
