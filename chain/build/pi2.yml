# Raspberry Pi 2

Tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 with a clean install of minimal Debian Jessie from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

* `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software

* Install the dependencies for Lethean except libunwind and libboost-all-dev

* Increase the system swap size:
```	
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```
* Install the latest version of boost (this may first require invoking `apt-get remove --purge libboost*` to remove a previous version if you're not using a clean install):
```
	cd  
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	tar xvfo boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	cd boost_1_64_0  
	./bootstrap.sh  
	sudo ./b2  
```
* Wait ~8 hours
```
	sudo ./bjam install
```
* Wait ~4 hours

* Change to the root of the source code directory and build:
```
        cd lethean
        make release
```
* Wait ~4 hours

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/lethean/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Lethean with `letheand --detach`

* You may wish to reduce the size of the swap file after the build has finished, and delete the boost directory from your home directory
